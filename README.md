# Fileshare
Download maps from DewritoHub from within Eldewrito

## What is Fileshare?
Fileshare is an addon CEF screen for Eldewrito that adds the capability to download maps in game from [DewritoHub](https://dewritohub.com). Users can search using tags such as #infection or through map names like TanksObama. Along with being able to search for files, users can sort them based on New, Top, Featured, and Updated. All info displayed is straight from the DewritoHub API.

Although this mod can do alot, there are a few issues that currently are impossible to solve. The most important issue is that you must restart the game after downloading maps to get them to appear in the maps list when going into the forge and multiplayer lobbies. This is an issue I have tried to solve, but could not find a way to do it.

## Download and Use
 Download the latest release [here]()
 Extract the zip to the root of your Eldewrito folder, and use Eldorado+Fileshare.exe instead of eldorado.exe in order to get fileshare working. Once the game is loaded just open the console and type `fileshare` to get the Fileshare to open.

## To-Do list and Bugs
1.  Find less hacky way to get map folder name
2.  Find way to make the FileshareHelper run in the background so you don't see it
3.  Cards cant be clicked unless you exit CEF screen and relaunch fileshare CEF screen
4.  Cards do not display map rating
