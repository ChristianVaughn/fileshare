# Fileshare
Download maps from DewritoHub from within Eldewrito

## Updates 3/30/19
A new update is being worked on to add more features to the fileshare. The main thing being worked on is a CEF map selection screen to allow users to load the map they just downloaded instead of restarting the game to do so. There is also some backend stuff being worked on such as extracting folders in a much nicer way than before, and some other components that were created just for the map selection screen. There is no ETA on the update yet because of my busy school schedule, but I will try to get it out ASAP.

## What is Fileshare?
Fileshare is an addon CEF screen for Eldewrito that adds the capability to download maps in game from [DewritoHub](https://dewritohub.com). Users can search using tags such as #infection or through map names like TanksObama. Along with being able to search for files, users can sort them based on New, Top, Featured, and Updated. All info displayed is straight from the DewritoHub API.

Although this mod can do alot, there are a few issues that currently are impossible to solve. The most important issue is that you must restart the game after downloading maps to get them to appear in the maps list when going into the forge and multiplayer lobbies. This is an issue I have tried to solve, but could not find a way to do it.

## Download and Use
 Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/cvaughn55/fileshare/releases)
 Extract the zip to the root of your Eldewrito folder(Aka the place where eldorado.exe is), and use EDFileshareLauncher.exe instead of eldorado.exe in order to get fileshare working. Once the game is loaded just open the console and type `fileshare` to get the Fileshare to open.

## To-Do list and Bugs

2. Try and bring back fileshare option in the maps menuwhat
3. Rename maps with same name.
4. Add new features as Finch upgrades the API. One of which potentially being uploading maps
5. Fix not being able to download straignt sandbox.map files uploaded

7. Download map preview image along with map for the map selector menu
